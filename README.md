# 🍻 Pub Runna

**Pub Runna** is a web-based pub and bar discovery and crawl-planning app built with **JavaScript, Leaflet, and OpenStreetMap**.  
It allows users to find nearby pubs, plan custom or random pub crawls, visualise walking routes, and save/share crawl plans — all directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 **Live location detection** or manual address input
- 🍺 **Find pubs and bars** within a custom radius
- 🔴 **Dead-zone filtering** to avoid pubs that are too close together
- 🧭 **Interactive map** powered by Leaflet & OpenStreetMap
- 🗺️ **Route planning** with estimated walking time and distance
- 🎲 **Random pub crawl generator**
- 💾 **Save, load, delete & share crawl plans**
- 📱 **Responsive layout** for desktop and mobile
- ✨ Clean, modern UI with onboarding overlay

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **Leaflet.js** – interactive maps
- **OpenStreetMap + Overpass API** – pub/bar data

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Set your location (GPS or manual address)
2. Choose a search radius and pub/bar type
3. Find nearby venues on the map
4. Add pubs to your **Ride-On** (crawl plan)
5. Generate routes, reorder stops, or auto-generate a random crawl
6. Save or share your crawl with a unique link
